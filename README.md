# Functional homodonty code

![figure](./figure.jpg)

*Note: This branch is currently being adapted to allow tooth stress to be measured in 3D Slicer and analyzed in R*

This is the code required to run the functional homodonty analyses in [Cohen et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1111/joa.13248). The idea is to generate an empirical cutoff for functional homodonty. Rather than classifying dentitions as homodont (all teeth serve the same function) or heterodont (teeth serving different functions) on whether or not the teeth look sufficiently different, we can determine empircally which teeth are likely to serve different functions based on the degree to which the amount of stress they experience differs from the surrounding teeth. 

To run this code:

1. Download the repository.
2. Open the .Rproj file (you will have to [download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) if you don't have it installed).
3. Open the RUNME.R file and run the example code!
